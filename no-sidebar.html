									<p>On a swelteringly hot afternoon in the southern part of India, as a hot wind blew across the paddy fields, I’d taken refuge under a large tree and was keenly observing the farmer and his family toiling away in the distance. I couldn’t help but feel sorry for the family that worked those fields in scorching temperatures. Moreover, the amount of manual effort that went into the cultivation process seemed taxing but automatable. As I investigated the reasons for the lack of automation, I was presented with answers that could be categorized into two buckets: exorbitant costs and apprehension of using new technology. It seemed that the local farming community did not share my views on technology as an enabler of progress and prosperity. As a city dweller, I’d never had a chance to observe farm life at such close quarters and this experience left me deeply disillusioned. I consider it a fundamental turning point in my outlook towards building technology and its subsequent use. Consequently, it has fueled and influenced all my professional ambitions, including this application to your esteemed department.</p>
									<p>Having been fascinated by technology from a very young age, I decided to pick Computer Science as my preferred program during my undergraduate studies. During the four-year undergraduate program, I thoroughly enjoyed taking classes like Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Organization, Data Structures with C programming, and Assembly Language Programming. They laid the foundation that proved to be vital for all my other courses and subsequent projects. With the guidance of a distinguished set of professors and the support of a fantastic peer group, my journey into internalizing the core concepts of Computer Science began in earnest. My love for programming further enhanced the joy of this endeavor. It also occurred to me that the product of any programming exercise must be simple but sophisticated. Simple in its ease of use and sophisticated in the feature set that is offered to the end-users.</p>
									<p>This realization was utterly important a couple of years into my undergraduate study when I had the aforementioned tryst with the farming community. By this time, I’d already assimilated the core principles of computing and had also spent a considerable number of weekends learning the Android application framework. Determined to find a low-cost solution that could potentially alleviate some of the problems posed by the manual cultivation techniques, my friend and I set about leveraging our acquired skills. While he had an electronics background and therefore worked on constructing a prototype of a farming robot, I focused my energies on building the software to run it. The robot was designed to perform various tasks like dibbling, seed broadcasting, covering the dibbles, and spraying the fields with herbicides. It was powered by a microcontroller board named Arduino Uno and could be operated using an Android-powered smartphone with Bluetooth connectivity. We followed a bottom-up design approach, where a feature requirement was broken into smaller parts and then assembled from the ground up. This approach helped us devise an interesting soil drilling and seed broadcasting technique for the robot called the screw drive mechanism. This mechanism replicated a see-saw motion using motors to force the drill bit into the soil and drop seeds into it, while a screw moved upwards. After the seed was planted, the motors switched the point of contact and applied pressure on the screw to extract the drill bit out of the soil.</p>
									<p>Within a few short weeks, we were able to successfully build and test the prototype. We gained recognition for our unique solution and secured the requisite funding needed to develop a larger prototype. While doubling up as a project manager for this effort, I set about incorporating the popular scrum agile methodology into our project workflow and kept our activities razor-focused on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that met our objectives. The final prototype was ready a few months later and was put through its paces on a nearby field with highly encouraging results.</p>
									<p>Buoyed by the success of this project, I wanted to explore further possibilities using the Android application framework and interned for Sparks Foundation, a non-profit organization that empowers students. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work with a wonderful team in building a state-of-the-art music player that prioritized user personalization. Having worn multiple hats as a Developer, UI Designer, and Software Tester throughout the project, I was able to develop decent competency in each role. Also, the experience of collaborating with a team that was highly skilled and motivated was intellectually quite stimulating and satisfying.</p>
									<p>Post this internship, I joined Accellor Inc as a Mobile Developer to build and deliver enterprise-scale mobile applications. One of the first deliverables that I worked on was a retail domain based mobile application. Built using React Native as the primary framework, the application facilitated a virtual interaction between end customers and retailers that sold PC hardware and software. The retailer could pull up information available for a product - including pricing, bundling, offers, availability, and promotions to provide customers with answers to every question.</p>
									<p>After the successful launch of retail application, I continued to work on using React Native and built a robust messaging solution for a company that operated within the healthcare domain. The mobile solution allowed patients to virtually interact with their healthcare providers and seek medical consultation. The doctors from any part of the world could consult with patients in deficit areas without expending travel, labor, or health costs.</p>
									<p>Having grown up during the dot com revolution, I’m convinced that my passion for technology is a natural progression. I believe technology has made human lives better than ever. However, I’ve understood from my encounter with the small farming community mentioned earlier, that there is a lot more work to do to make it widely accessible and also break the cost barriers that stand in our way of further progress. I also intend to pursue my long-term desire to build a digital startup that uses cutting-edge technology to improve agricultural productivity.</p>
